   or B - place nanorc as .nanorc for everyuser you intend to use it with
3. enjoy :)
4. mail upgraded or additional syntaxes to vojcek@tlen.pl

WARNING: If You do not use Gentoo some syntaxes may show harmless errors during start.
	Just hashout those lines relating to the Gentoo Disto like gentoo.nanorc

WARNING 2: If You want to place .nanorc files in directory other than /usr/share/nano
	and use my /etc/nanorc config replace all instances of .nanorc file paths
	 in that file as they are hardcoded.
	
	If anyone knows the more portable solution please drop me e-mail.
