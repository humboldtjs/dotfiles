This package contains settings for nano syntax highlighting written by various authors and derived 
mainly from http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-86562.html to which I made 
several contribusions myself on top of them.

This is useful if one uses black background. I do not know anything about white or any other backgrounds
as I always keep my screen as black as possible. I case you wonder why it is so when someone tells me
"why this job is not finished yet you had it written black on white?!!!" or "didnt you get that memo?"
I would feel better about my laziness ;) and therefore I whould not care about it working on white 
or any other background. If that is a problem for you than this is a not a package for you and please visit 
above web site for further info and help getting it work or talk to the hand :) Last possible solution 
is to hit your screen with the fist right about
					     ^^^^
					    <HERE>
					     vvvv
					     
If your syntaxes are of better use then these than drop them over here vojcek@tlen.pl
same goes for those written for other backgrounds. I would include them if I receive any
